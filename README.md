# CMake template for a library project

This project is a simple template to start a static library project. It includes a small main executable for quick debugging. It also includes a text project using the [Catch2 library](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

The build.bat script tells CMAKE to build the Visual Studio 2017 solution for this project.
